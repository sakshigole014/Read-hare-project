    <p>A rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa. Roses can be seen in many gardens. In a big vineyard, a bush of roses are planted at the end of each row of vines. As long as the roses stay healthy, the vine growers assume their vines are healthy as well. Roses can bloom through summer, adding color to gardens.</p>
